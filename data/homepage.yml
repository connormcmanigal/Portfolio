  title: "Get to know me:"
  content: 
    <p class="lead">
    My area of focus is leveraging data science to drive actionable business strategies. With a strong foundation in analytical and
    problem-solving skills, I specialize in data manipulation and visualization, statistical analysis, and machine learning to develop predictive models and generate insights
    that inform decision making. My hands-on experience spans across various tools, including Python, R, SQL, Java, Google Cloud Platform (GCP) along with libraries such as 
    Pandas, NumPy, Seaborn, Matplotlib, SciPy, Scikit-learn, PyTorch, TensorFlow, ggplot2, and tidyverse. These tools are my go-to for working with both structured and 
    unstructured data, building models, and deriving meaningful insights.
    </p>
    &nbsp;
    <p class="lead">
    Beyond data science, there's much more to know about me. I have over 15 years of experience in water polo, 
    including four years as a Division 1 student-athlete at UC San Diego. This experience shaped my soft skills in time management, leadership, teamwork, and discipline,
    all while fostering a strong work ethic and resilience. These qualities enable me to excel under pressure and in fast paced environments.
    When I'm not immersed in data, I enjoy staying active and practicing my hunter-gatherer skills through freediving, spearfishing, lobstering, and fishing. 
    There's something uniquely fulfilling about sustainably providing my own meals.

    - title: "UnVAEling Network Anomalies: Detecting Network Attacks with Variational Autoencoders"
      description: "In this group project, we explored the performance of two variational autoencoder (VAE) approaches—standard VAE and Mixed-loss VAE (MLVAE)—for network traffic monitoring and security. VAEs are particularly effective in scenarios with sparse labels, making them ideal for detecting the rare occurrence of network attacks. We trained both VAE models on normal traffic data and validated their performance using the RT-IoT2022 dataset, which simulates communication between smart devices and includes nine types of attacks. For validation, we implemented one-left-out classification, utilizing Bayesian optimization to define reconstruction loss thresholds that maximize the separation between normal and attack traffic. This approach enabled us to optimize model accuracy for normal traffic while minimizing errors for attack traffic. By implementing multinomial classification, we enhanced our ability to identify specific types of attack traffic, moving beyond traditional binary classification methods. After tuning the hyperparameters, we evaluated each model’s filtering accuracy and achieved a mean AUC of 0.7534 with MLVAE1 and 0.8092 with MLVAE2. Although these results are lower than those found in similar studies, they highlight MLVAE's potential for detecting stealthy or novel attacks, particularly in scan detection, by effectively leveraging reconstruction loss thresholds."

    - title: "Leveraging Sentiment Analysis and Data Augmentation to Recreate Recipe Scoring Algorithm with Limited Data"
      description: "In this project, my team and I investigated the role of sentiment analysis in predicting algorithmic scores for recipe reviews using a dataset of 18,000 reviews from the UCI Machine Learning Library. We employed VADER and TextBlob to derive polarity and subjectivity scores, which were used to augment our dataset alongside original features like user reputation and response counts. We trained and compared the performance of Multi-Layered Perceptron (MLP) and Gradient Boosting Regressor (GBR) models, focusing on their capacity to capture complex relationships and non-linear patterns. For model training, we utilized an 80/20 data split and applied techniques like GridSearchCV for hyperparameter tuning. Our findings revealed that the GBR outperformed the MLP, achieving a Mean Absolute Error (MAE) of 21.446 compared to 22.672. While the study validated the predictive power of sentiment scores, it also highlighted limitations, such as the reliance on limited data and general sentiment analysis packages and tools."
