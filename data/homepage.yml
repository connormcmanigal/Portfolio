  title: "Get to know me:"
  content: 
    <p class="lead">
    <strong>My area of focus is leveraging data science to drive actionable business strategies.</strong> With a strong foundation in analytical and
    problem-solving skills, I specialize in data manipulation, statistical analysis, and machine learning to develop predictive models and generate insights
    that inform decision making. My hands-on experience spans across various tools, including Python, R, SQL, Java, Google Cloud Platform (GCP) along with libraries such as 
    Pandas, NumPy, Seaborn, Matplotlib, SciPy, Scikit-learn, PyTorch, TensorFlow, ggplot2, and tidyverse. These tools are my go-to for working with both structured and 
    unstructured data, building models, and deriving meaningful insights.
    </p>
    <p class="lead">
    <strong>Beyond data science, there's much more to know about me.</strong> I have over 15 years of experience in water polo, 
    including four years as a Division 1 student-athlete at UC San Diego. This experience shaped my soft skills in time management, leadership, teamwork, and discipline,
    all while fostering a strong work ethic and resilience. These qualities enable me to excel under pressure and in fast paced environments.
    When I'm not immersed in data, I enjoy staying active and practicing my hunter-gatherer skills through freediving, spearfishing, lobstering, and fishing. 
    There's something uniquely fulfilling about sustainably providing my own meals.
